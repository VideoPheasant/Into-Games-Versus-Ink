The eponymous & iconic Tilly Sizzle is depicted on the logo for TSSTSS in her usual form. That of a cartoon laser pistol with eyelashes. She was a more appropriate mascot back when her company sold weapons, but she seems happier now they've moved on to snacks. She still has that far off look in her eyes though.

Tilly's slices come with an absolute guarantee that they will be slightly too spicy for the consumer. You'd have to be pretty hardcore to pick something that you're guaranteed not to enjoy.

The vending machine shudders and smokes slightly before a dry foil package drops into its pick-up box with a light crinkling sound. You can smell it already, without opening it. Seems intimidatingly spicy.

The packaging is almost entirely disclaimer text printed on an image of Tilly Sizzle's face. She looks concerned.

*[Read the disclaimer.]

<i>WARNING. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS GLUTEN, PEANUTS, QUANTUM WAVEFORM RECEIVERS AP-105,AP-103,AP-5^787,AP-0000,AP-DOROTHY.</i>

    **[On second thought... No.]
    
        The packaging senses your hesitation, and the look in Tilly Sizzle's eyes seems to shift from haunted worry to bitter disappointment. Too spicy for you, is it? The package heats up rapidly in your hand until it's slightly too hot to hold and you drop it with a yelp. It cooks itself to ash right there on the floor in front of you. The thick smoke wafting from the torched packaging carries complex layers of pepper and caraway. It makes your mouth water.

The slices themselves are light brown unassuming discs that remind you of dried apricot. You drop one onto the palm of your hand to examine it, and almost immediately your hand begins to tingle. The spice is on your skin and it's a little bit much. You instinctively pop the slice in your mouth.

It tastes incredible. It's savoury. It's complex. It's sweet but also mature. It's earthy but also refreshing. It's... Oh here comes the spice. No. No. It's too spicy. It's just a little bit too spicy to enjoy it really.

*[Spit it out.]

    You splutter and spit it out.

    
*[Just bear it. Force yourself to chew.]

No. No. It's really <i>too</i> spicy. You try to inhale and the air passing over the slice becomes hostile to all human life on its way down your throat. You splutter and just like that you've lost it.

-

The slightly too spicy slice slops onto the ground trailing smoke like the tail of a slimy comet.

The packaging seems to sense your rejection and heats up rapidly in your hand until it's slightly too hot to hold and you drop it with a yelp. It cooks itself to ash right there on the floor in front of you. The thick smoke wafting from the torched packaging makes your mouth water, but you know it's actually too spicy to enjoy.

- The machine whirs - there's a muffled <i>thud</i> as a small gelatinous cube falls into the open vending slot.

*Pick it up
->Pick_Green_Cube

*Yeah, no thanks
->Vending_Machine_Entrance

===Pick_Green_Cube===
-You pick up the green cube and inspect it. It looks like ordinary jelly, but feels denser. There are small specks of what you assume to be some kind of ground-up leaf suspended inside it.

- It takes a moment for you to place the savory, metallic taste. The cube bursts in your mouth, releasing a creamy fondant centre. It's the taste of an extremely rare steak combined with the texture of a soufflé.

Was that... blood flavoured?

The name "Sir Jerry Breen's Fantastical Jellybeans" is one you are very familiar with. It is one of the most infamous, and exorbitantly expensive candies in the multi-verse. Despite their unreasonable pricing, the jellybeans still see wide use. In fact they are dubbed the "perfect jellybeans".

+[Today is a special occasion, you can have some.]
->HaveSome
*[On second thought, I'd like to try something else.]
->Vending_Machine_Entrance

=HaveSome
Your gaze falls on the green, square button with the iconic figure of "Sir Jerry Breen" appearing to be worn out. Only one last bag of jellybeans sits in the vending machine. You press the button. It feels soft and dampened.

It doesn't seem to work.
+[Press the button again.]
->PressAgain
*[Don't bother, it's probably broken.]

You press the button. It softly slides back inside, and out...

Unexpectedly... The vending machine responds to your selection with a soulless, automated message sounding from its speaker:

"Sir Jerry Breen's Fantastical Jellybeans are sure to delight you and sure not to disappoint!"

The vending machine clacks and whirs, struggling to push your item in the drop box.

*[Give it a minute.]

*[Give it a good shake (like in the movies).]
->GiveItAShake

=GiveItAMinute
Patience is a virtue, you think to yourself.
*[Wait a bit longer.]
->Wait

=Wait
Catching yourself dozing off, you snap back to reality, finding the jellybeans bag in the drop box. 

You enthusiastically pick them up.

=GiveItAShake
Hoping someone watches, you put on a performance. You bump into the vending machine, shaking it, again, and again, until the plastic rustling against the metal and the final thud of the drop cap off the show.

You proudly look around to find out not a soul turned to pay attention. You feel a bit embarrassed, but nonetheless brush it off and pick up the jellybeans bag.

The tale of our founder Sir Jerry Breen is well-known across the multi-verse. A tale of an inventor, a saviour, and a peacemaker. His “fantastical” jellybeans united the multi-verse after millennia of war and devastation. Where there was nothing but difference and division, Sir Jerry Breen showed the world that there was much more in common, and where differences remained, his jellybeans more than made up for.

"Sir Jerry Breen's Fantastical Jellybeans" don't have any taste to begin with, but once they come into contact with saliva they perform a rapid, harmless analysis of the organism's genetic make-up. The result? Flavours adapt to your unique preferences, making them truly countless, and colours can range far beyond the visible light spectrum often making them hardly visible to the naked human eye.

Have these jellybeans at your discretion, as once you've tasted perfection, there's no going back.
*[It's jellybean time!]
->HaveAJellybean

=HaveAJellybean
You swiftly tear the bag open in one clean cut.

You gaze inside, and see a sea of shining colour, jellybeans ranging from ruby red, emerald green, diamond blue, golden yellow, even to silvery see-through, colours far beyond your eyes allow you to discern.

You close your eyes and give them a good shuffle. You sink your fingers deep in the bag, and pick out...

A {~Ruby Red|Emerald Green|Diamond Blue|Golden Yellow|Silvery See-through} jellybean!

You playfully toss it in your mouth and chew. The jellybean initially leaves you unimpressed, tasting bland.As you continue chewing, you gradually start to sense a new flavour, one that words can't describe. It's unlike the taste of a fruit, chocolate, or sugary drink. It's a novelty, a flavour unique to you and one that no other has experienced.

You continue chewing and enjoying the jellybean...
